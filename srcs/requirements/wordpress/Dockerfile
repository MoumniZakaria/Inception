# Create the directory where the PHP-FPM socket file will be placed
# Without this directory, PHP-FPM will fail to start because it cannot bind to the socket
# -p means "create parent directories as needed" (no error if directory already exists)

# CMD defines the default command that will run when the container starts
# CMD [ "php-fpm7.4", "-F" ]
# "php-fpm7.4" is the binary to run the PHP FastCGI Process Manager
# "-F" flag means "run in the foreground" (do not daemonize), which is necessary for Docker containers
